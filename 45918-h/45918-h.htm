<p class="tb">The numbers and names used in this book are those adopted by the American
Ornithologists&rsquo; Union, and are known both in this country and abroad. The
lengths given are averages; our small birds often vary considerably and may
be found either slightly larger or smaller than those quoted.</p>
<p>On some of the pages a number of sub-species are mentioned. Sub-species often
cause confusion, because they are usually very similar to the original; they can best
be identified by the locality in which they are found.</p>
<p>The nests and eggs are described, as they often lead to the identity of a bird.
We would suggest that you neatly, and with ink, make a cross against the name of
each bird that you see in your locality, and also that you write at the top of the
page the date of the arrival and departure of each bird as you note it; these dates
vary so much in different localities that we have not attempted to give them. As
many will not wish to soil their books we would suggest that they have a leather-covered
copy for the library and a cloth one for pocket use.</p>

<h3 class="genus">DIVING BIRDS&mdash;Order Pygopodes.
<br />GREBES&mdash;Family Colymbid&aelig;.</h3>
<h3 id="bWesternGrebe">WESTERN GREBE.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">1. </span><span class="sci">&AElig;chmophorus occidentalis. </span><span class="siz">25 to 29 inches.</span></div>
<p>This is the largest of the grebe family. In summer the back
of the neck is black, but in winter it is gray like the back.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A floating mass of decayed rushes, sometimes attached
to the upright stalks; 2 to 5 pale bluish white eggs are laid,
usually much nest stained (2.40 &times; 1.55). Breeding in colonies.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Western North America, from the Dakotas and
Manitoba to the Pacific, and north to southern Alaska.</p>
<h3 id="bHolboellGrebe">HOLBOELL GREBE.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">2. </span><span class="sci">Colymbus Holboelli. </span><span class="siz">19 inches.</span></div>
<p>This is next to the <a href="#bWesternGrebe">Western Grebe</a> in size, both being larger
than any of the others. In summer, they are very handsomely
marked, as shown in the illustration, but in winter have the
usual dress of gray and white.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Similar to above, the eggs averaging smaller (2.35 &times;
1.25).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;North America, breeding from northwestern Alaska,
in the interior of Canada and North Dakota. Winters usually
on the coasts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<div class="imgr" id="fig2">
<img src="images/p010.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="527" />
</div>
<h3 id="bHornedGrebe">HORNED GREBE.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">3. </span><span class="sci">Colymbus auritus. </span><span class="siz">14 inches.</span></div>
<p>In winter this Grebe is one of the plainest in its dress of gray
and white, but summer brings a great change, making it one of
the most attractive, with its black, puffy head, and buffy white
ear tufts, the front of the neck a rich chestnut color. Their
food consists almost wholly of small fish.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Is a loosely built mass of vegetation floating in the
bog and water holes of the western prairies. The eggs, 3 to 7
in number, are brownish yellow (1.70 &times; 1.15).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Breeds from Dakota and Illinois northward; winters
to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="bEaredGrebe">EARED GREBE.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">4. </span><span class="sci">Colymbus nigricollis californicus. </span><span class="siz">13 inches.</span></div>
<p>This species is rarely found as far east as the Mississippi
River. In summer the neck is black, lacking the chestnut color
of the former. It can always be distinguished from the <a href="#bHornedGrebe">Horned</a>
by the upper mandible being straight on the top.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In colonies similar to the above, laying from 3 to 8
eggs, which are usually nest stained to a brownish cream color.</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;From the Mississippi to the Pacific, nesting from
Texas to British Columbia.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<div class="imgr" id="fig3">
<img src="images/p011.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="511" />
</div>
<h3 id="bPiedBilledGrebe">PIED-BILLED GREBE.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">6. </span><span class="sci">Podilymbus podiceps. </span><span class="siz">13&frac12; inches.</span></div>
<p>This species cannot be mistaken for any others of the
grebes in any plumage, because of its stout compressed bill
and brown eyes, all the others having red eyes. In summer the
bill is nearly white, with a black band encircling it; the throat
is black; breast and sides brownish-gray; the eye encircled with
a white ring.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Made of a mass of decayed weeds and rushes, floating
in shallow ponds or on the edges of lakes among the rushes.
Five to 8 brownish white eggs are laid (1.70 &times; 1.18).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Whole of N. A., breeding in small colonies or pairs.</p>
<h3 id="bLoonGreatNorthernDiver">LOON; GREAT NORTHERN DIVER.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">7. </span><span class="sci">Gavia immer. </span><span class="siz">31 to 35 inches.</span></div>
<p>In shape and motions the loons very much resemble the
<a href="#bWesternGrebe">grebes</a>, except in size, being much larger. The common loon
is the most beautiful of them all, having a velvety black iridescent
head with slashes of white on the throat and neck and
spots of white on the wings and back.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Usually built under some shelter of bushes or rushes
on the edge of some of the larger ponds or lakes. The two eggs
are a yellowish brown, with black spots (3.50 &times; 2.25).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<div class="imgr" id="fig4">
<img src="images/p012.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="513" />
</div>
<h3 id="bPacificLoon">PACIFIC LOON.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">10. </span><span class="sci">Gavia pacifica. </span><span class="siz">30 to 32 inches.</span></div>
<p>This species differs from the <a href="#bLoonGreatNorthernDiver">Loon</a> in having the crown gray,
and white streaks down the back of the neck, and in the

<p>These beautiful birds are often known as &ldquo;Sea Swallows,&rdquo;
because of their similarity in flight to those well-known land
birds. They are the picture of grace as they dart about high
in the air, bill pointed downward, alert and ready to dart
down upon any small fish that may take their fancy.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;A slight depression in the sand, rarely lined with
grass, in which are laid three, sometimes four, eggs varying
in color from almost white to brownish, thickly spotted with
brown and lavender (1.80 &times; 1.30).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Throughout North America; breeding from Manitoba
to the Gulf Coast.</p>

<p>This bird differs from the above in the red of the bill being
more blackish at the tip, and the under parts being a pearly
gray in place of white, tail not quite as much forked, and
shorter; edge of outer primaries and outer tail-feathers
blackish.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;These breed much more abundantly on the Atlantic

<p>This species has the upper parts variegated with reddish
brown, black and white; the under parts are pure white with
a wide black band across the breast, as in illustration. It
has a peculiar, slightly upturned bill, which is used, as the

<p>The plumage on this bird is entirely black, with a bluish
wash on the upper parts, and brownish black below. They
are found upon the rocky coasts and islands more frequently
than on the sandy beaches. Their eggs are laid upon the
rocks or small pebbles with no attempt at nest building;
three or four eggs are laid of an olive buff color spotted and
blotched with shades of black and brown (2.20 &times; 1.55). Found
on the Pacific coast of North America, from Lower California
to Alaska.</p>

<p>This is one of the most celebrated of the &ldquo;Game Birds,&rdquo;

persistently hunted that it is getting to be a rare bird; it
gets to be more common as we go south as far as Florida,
and through the middle west. It has been introduced in many
places on the Pacific coast, and now is fairly abundant in parts
of California, Oregon and Washington. They feed largely
upon insects and grain, and about the grain fields is where they
are mostly found.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;These are built along the roadsides or beside stone
walls or any dry locality affording good shelter. It is concealed
in the tall grass or weeds, and arched over with grass.
They lay from ten to twenty pure white eggs. Often two

in connection with their clownish plumage, has given them
the name of &ldquo;Fool Quail.&rdquo; The bill is very stout and compressed;
crest large, puffy and flat. They frequent dry deserts,
valleys or mountains to quite a high altitude. Their eggs,

the ruffs on a grouse are long tufts of rounded or square
ended feathers, and below these a peculiar sac; bright orange
in the breeding season, and capable of being inflated to the
size of a small orange; this is done when the bird makes
its familiar &ldquo;booming&rdquo; noise. They are one of the best
&ldquo;table birds,&rdquo; being of good size and excellent flavor.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In hollows on the ground in the cover of tufts of

about the Rocky Mountains and to the westward. In fall and
winter their food consists almost entirely of the leaves of
the sagebrush, their flesh being unfit to eat at this season.
In the mating season they indulge in the usual antics of the
grouse family. They have the same peculiar sacs on the
sides of the neck which they inflate so that the whole neck
is a small orange colored balloon, at the same time spreading
their long pointed tail feathers to their fullest extent, and
strutting about after the manner of the turkey.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Are shallow hollows in the ground, under, generally,

<p>This little hawk is one of the most active of the family, and
from this fact it gets its name (Velox), meaning swift. It is
often seen in woods, orchards or even in large cities, in which
latter place it does good service in catching English sparrows.
They also eat a great many mice and meadow moles.
It is one of the most daring as well as beautiful of the
small hawks.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;It is a rude and very frail platform of twigs and
leaves placed in the crotch of a tree, usually at about fifteen
feet from the ground, sometimes higher. Three white eggs,
blotched with brown.</p>

elevation from the ground than the former, and built in the
same manner. Three bluish white eggs unmarked or faintly
specked with brown (1.90 &times; 1.45).</p>

low open lands covered with sage bush, where their food
consists almost wholly of the small rodents; squirrels; mice
and grasshoppers, the latter being eaten in large numbers.</p>

Tail is barred. Their flight is perfectly silent, which aids them

get without stopping in their flight, just swooping down,
and extending their long legs, armed with wicked little sharp
claws, and it is all over with the little rodent, he being carried

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">377a. </span><span class="sci">Surnia ulula caparoch. </span><span class="siz">15 inches.</span></div>
<p>This owl, mottled and barred, gray and black, might readily
be taken for a Hawk, because of his hawk-like appearance,
and long rounded tail. They are very active birds especially in
the day time, and they do most of their hunting in daylight
rather than at night. Their food consists of small rodents
and many small birds.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;In hollow trees or upon the ground. Four to eight
white eggs (1.50 &times; 1.20).</p>

<p>These birds are wholly different in plumage, form and habits
from any other American Owls. Easily identified by their long,
slender and scantily feathered legs. They are brownish above,
spotted with white, and under parts are white spotted with
brown. Tail dark brown, with five white bars across it. They
are an abundant and useful species west of the Mississippi.
They live in the same regions as the Prairie Dogs are found,
and use the deserted burrows of these animals, or take them by
force, for they are more than a match for these curious animals.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Generally in quite large communities in burrows in
the ground, usually lining them with grass and feathers. They
may often be seen sitting at the opening of their burrows during
the day time. Six to ten white eggs are laid (1.25 &times; 1.00).</p>

<p>These interesting little Owls, which are found in the Rocky
Mountains, westward from British Columbia to Mexico, feed
in the day time upon insects, mice and occasionally small birds.
They are to be seen in the wooded districts. Nest in holes of
trees. Four eggs (1.00 &times; .90).</p>

color crossed by several bands of black. They live largely
on the small rodents and birds which they secure during the

(1.10 &times; .90).</p>
<h3 id="bElfOwl">ELF OWL.</h3>
<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">381. </span><span class="sci">Micropallas whitneyi. </span><span class="siz">6 inches.</span></div>
<p>This odd little bird is the smallest of the family found in
America. In plumage it may be described as being very like
a small <a href="#bScreechOwl">Screech Owl</a>, without the ear tufts, only with the
pattern of the markings much finer. They are quite abundant
in central Mexico and in southern Arizona, where they build
their nests in deserted Woodpecker holes, or perhaps more frequently
in the giant cactus. It differs from the preceding in
being a bird of the night, rarely flying in daylight. They feed
almost exclusively upon insects, and rarely a mole or field
mouse. They lay from three to five white eggs, having a
slight gloss (1.02 &times; .90).</p>

<p>This curious species is known as the &ldquo;Chaparral Cock,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ground Cuckoo,&rdquo; &ldquo;Snake Killer,&rdquo; etc. Its upper parts are
a glossy greenish brown, each feather being edged or fringed
with white. The tail is very long, broad and graduated, the
central feathers being much the longest; the feathers being
tipped with white. They are noted for their swiftness of
foot, getting over the ground at an astonishing rate, aided
by their outstretched wings and spread tail, which act as
aeroplanes. Their legs are long, and they have two toes in
front and two back. Their food consists of caterpillars, lizards
and small snakes.</p>

by its blackish, long tail, tipped with white, and its yellow
under-bill. Reddish brown patch on the wings.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Is made of twigs loosely put together, and lined with
grass, or shreds of grape vine bark. The nests are generally
very shabbily built and so nearly flat on top that the eggs
will frequently roll out. They are located near the ground
in low bushes or trees; three or four eggs are deposited at
intervals of several days, and frequently young birds and eggs
are found in the nest at the same time. Like the Flicker this
bird will continue laying if one egg is removed at a time,
and as many as twelve have been taken from the same nest
by this means. Eggs are a pale greenish blue (1.20 &times; .90).</p>

<p>The rattling note of this well known bird is familiar in almost

small fish are common, throughout North America. Their food
consists almost entirely of small fish, which they catch by
plunging upon from high in the air, where they will hover
over the water similar to the <a href="#bAmericanOspreyFishHawk">Osprey</a>, or they will spend their
time sitting upon an overhanging limb, and, when a fish is
seen, drop from that upon the fish, usually taking it back to
the limb to be eaten.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;Is located at the end of burrows, which they dig out
of the sand banks or the banks of creeks and rivers, sometimes
extending back from six to eight feet, usually with a
little rise in the tunnel for the purpose of keeping it dry. They
lay from five to eight glossy white eggs (1.35 &times; 1.05).</p>

<p>The nighthawk may be distinguished from the Whip-poor-wills
by its forked tail in place of the rounded tail of the
&ldquo;Poor-wills.&rdquo; It also has a white band near the end of the
tail, and across the primaries, the latter making a very conspicuous
mark when in flight.</p>
<p><b>Nest.</b>&mdash;They lay their eggs upon the ground or on a ledge
with no attempt at nest building. The two eggs are a grayish
white color, marbled, blotched and spotted with darker shades
of gray and brown (1.20 &times; .95). Found from the plains to the
Pacific and from British Columbia to Mexico.</p>

<p>The plumage of the Swift is a dull sooty black, somewhat
lighter on the under parts. The tail is slightly forked and does
not have the spines which are usual with this family. Although
the general habits of this species are well known, but
little is known of their nesting; they are seen during the breeding
season about the higher ranges of their United States range,
and are supposed to nest in the crevices of cliffs at high altitudes.</p>

<div class="sh3"><span class="aou">424. </span><span class="sci">Ch&aelig;tura vauxi. </span><span class="siz">4&frac12; inches.</span></div>
<p>This small Swift is not nearly as common as the preceding, is
much paler in color and white on the under parts and throat.
Their habits are much like the last, only that they make use of
hollow trees in which to place their nests, which are made of
twigs glued to the tree with the glutinous saliva of the birds,
forming a very shallow platform in which they deposit three or
four pure white eggs. They are on the wing much of the time
during the day catching insects, or several pairs seemingly at
play in the air, generally at quite high elevations, toward dusk
returning to their nesting places.</p>

<p>A handsome bird, in fact, the most beautiful and graceful of
this family. Its flight is very rapid, and they congregate in
thousands about the tops of inaccessible cliffs, where in small
burrows in the earth or under the sods, or in crevices they
build their nests, which are generally made of roots and
grasses and lined with feathers. Four or five dull white eggs
are laid (.85 &times; .50).</p>
<p><b>Range.</b>&mdash;Western United States, mostly in the Rocky Mountains,
and in California ranges north to Canada borders.</p>

Rocky Mountains, breeding in the mountains south to Colorado.
They are all restless birds, seldom making a long stop
in one place, but flitting from one locality to another. After
the breeding season, they congregate in large flocks and keep
together about the snow line, getting their supply of seed and
insect food. Their nesting habits and their eggs are the

from the different coniferous trees, the latter of which they
most often frequent, building their nests in these trees of twigs
and rootlets loosely put together and placed on the crotch of
a horizontal limb; usually four eggs, of a greenish white
color, spotted finely with reddish brown (.65 &times; .45). They
have a habit, while feeding, of clinging to the under side

<p>To be found in the whole of the northern hemisphere,
breeding within the Arctic Circle and wintering south to the
central portions of the United States. They are one of the
birds that change their dress completely from winter to summer,
in color. In winter they are a clear black and white, while
in summer the black is changed for a coat of chestnut or
brownish. They are to be found in the winters, on the hillsides
and in fields where the weeds are showing through,
feeding upon the small seeds, and at this time they are as
restless and uncertain as the snowflake itself, from which it
is called. They nest on the ground, making it of dried grasses
and lining with finer grass and feathers; the four or five eggs

is very large and stout, but the general makeup of the bird,
with its long crest, is much to be admired. They build their
nest of twigs, roots and grasses, loosely put together, which
is placed in bushes, vines or low trees. Their three or four
eggs are a pale bluish white, with varied markings or spots
of shades of brown, mostly about the larger end (1.00 &times; .70).

brother. In habits they appear to be much the same, their
song is wonderfully sweet and clear. They are very quiet
birds, and when nesting will almost allow one to touch them
before leaving. Their nests are simply a few straws and sticks,
loosely laid on the forks of some horizontal branch of a bush
or low tree, so frail that frequently their eggs can be seen
from beneath. They lay four eggs of a bluish green, spotted

<p>A northern variety, breeding in Alaska and northward, winters
to California and the northern states of the United
States. It may be identified from the following by the
markings on the wings of white and yellow, and the larger
band of yellow at the end of the tail. The wax-like appendages
on the wings and tail may be found on both species.</p>
<p>Their nests are made of rootlets, grass and moss, and placed
in bushes or trees at a few feet from the ground. Usually
four eggs are laid, of a grayish color, sharply spotted with
brown (.95 &times; .70).</p>

<p>These are a North American bird, and great travelers in
large flocks all over the country, separating at breeding time,
and mating up, with a pair or two selecting some orchard
or suitable locality to remain during nesting time. They
breed throughout the northern United States and north into
Canada. Their nests are placed in almost any kind of tree, on
horizontal limbs, made of twigs, rootlets, string and grass, in
which they lay usually four eggs of a dull grayish color, spotted
with dark brown, mostly about the larger end (.85 &times; .60).</p>

In winter they have been known frequently to live about
cities, catching the English Sparrows in the parks and city
streets. They tear their food to pieces with their bill,
which is shaped similar to that of a hawk&rsquo;s, while their feet
are small and weak, not at all resembling the hawk&rsquo;s feet.
Their nests are placed in thickets or thorny bushes, and are
made of shreds of vines, grasses and plant down. Four to six
grayish white eggs are laid, these being spotted and blotched
with shades of brown (1.05 &times; .75).</p>

within a few feet of the ground on an overhanging limb, suspended
from a fork, and made of strips of bark, plant fiber
and often with pieces of string and paper included in its
construction. Three or four eggs are white, specked sparingly

bird is simply nothing more than a <a href="#bBushTit">Bush-tit</a> with his Sunday
clothes on, or not a full suit, but a bright yellow head and
neck dress. They are abundant and active little fellows in
the thick chaparral brush, where they build a nest more bulky
than the &ldquo;tit&rdquo; but not as artistic or compact. They are
placed in thorn or other bushes within a few feet of the
ground, made of twigs and weeds, and lined with fur and
feathers. Their eggs, four to six, are white. For amusement,
they construct one or two additional nests, in which they
remain at night.</p>
